# COVID Atlas
## NASA Spaces Apps Challenge
### Developers: Cesar y Leo Camacho. 
###### ||NASA Products: GIBS API || Category: Health & Education ||
###### ||Countries 🌎 🇲🇽 🇧🇷 🇨🇷||

#### A risk measurement tool for populations and governments to take decision on their daily life’s during pandemic events, by combining satellite imagery , statistics and infection rate tracking in near real time.  

#### Inspiration:
 
We combine data sources from NASA and socio economic statistics to provide people and Public Organisations a near real time App where they can take better decisions during pandemic times and also for Governments to plan Lockdown strategies and measure KPIs results from the stablished protocols.  

What inspired your team to choose this challenge? 

* Our team comes from Development countries where this tool can support people to take better decisions and prevent the spread of pandemics. Also want to put our expertise on data science for the human benefit.   

What was your approach to developing this project?  
*  Build a tool to help people to take better decisions during extraordinary events such as COVID19 pandemic.  

How did you use space agency data in your project? 
* We ingest the Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS) from NASA and combine it with other Health statistics and other external services, to provide users accurate information via a user-friendly interface. 

What tools, coding languages, hardware, software did you use to develop your project? 
* NASA's Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS) APIs 
* COVID19 Open APIs 
* Apache Spark  
* Casandra for Database 
* Coding Languages: Python, C sharp and Javascript 
* Power BI for Data Visualization 

What problems and achievements did your team have?
* Our main challenge was to determine an accurate way on how to predict a spread rate of a virus/pandemic based on satellite imagery, health statistics and other external data, to provide a confidence score for end users.  
* We are proud of our team achievement of building a Live Demo
